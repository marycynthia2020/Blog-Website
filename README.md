# OmniPress: Hub for all kinds of News

**Description**

OmniPress is a dynamic blog website designed to be your go-to source for news across diverse categories, from technology to sports and everything in between. This platform allows users to sign up, log in, create their own posts, view articles published by others, comment on posts, and delete their own contributions. It's a vibrant community for sharing and consuming content. The application leverages a robust API for its backend, ensuring efficient data management and a seamless user experience.

**Features** 
* User Authentication: Secure sign-up and log-in functionality.
* Create Posts: Users can easily compose and publish their own blog posts.
* View Posts: Explore a wide range of articles created by other users.
* Commenting System: Engage with content by leaving comments on posts.
* Post Management: Users have full control to delete their own posts.
* Categorized Content: News spanning various categories like technology, sports, and more.
* Responsive Design: A user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

**Technologies Used**
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* React Router: For declarative routing in React applications.
* TanStack Query (formerly React Query): For data fetching, caching, and state management.

I'm actively working on improving OmniPress. Users will soon have the ability to edit their own posts after creation, allowing for corrections or updates.
